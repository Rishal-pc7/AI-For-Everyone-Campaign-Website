## 🤖 The "AI-Native" Build Process
This project was not just "coded"; it was engineered using a **Multi-Agent AI Workflow**. I acted as the **Product Architect**, orchestrating four distinct AI tools to move from concept to deployment in record time.

### 🛠️ The Tech Stack & AI Agents

| Stage | AI Agent / Tool | Role in Workflow |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Strategy** | **Google Gemini** | **Product Manager (PM)**<br>Analyzed the 10-page campaign PDF, generated the PRD, defined user personas (KuttyMakers vs. Young Makers), and wrote all narrative copy. |
| **2. Design** | **v0.dev** | **UI Architect**<br>Drafted the initial "Glassmorphism" layout, the "Mission Control" Hero section, and the "Glitch Scroll" structure based on text prompts. |
| **3. Polish** | **Lovable** | **Frontend Designer**<br>Refined all the sections animation and the "Resource Matcher" logic gate for mobile responsiveness. |
| **4. Assembly** | **Antigravity IDE** | **Full-Stack Engineer**<br>Used for final code assembly, routing, Next.js optimization, and blending the generated components into a cohesive app. |

## 🌟 Key Features (and how AI built them)

### 1. The "Mission Control" Hero
* **Concept:** A blend of Kerala's heritage and AI future.
* **AI Contribution:** **Midjourney** generated the "Cyber-Heritage" horizon silhouette. **v0** generated the "Gemini Terminal" code. I manually coded the blending logic to layer the map, terminal, and silhouette.

### 2. The "Consumer vs. Creator" Narrative Scroll
* **Concept:** A scroll-triggered transformation from "Glitchy Chaos" (Problems) to "Clean Future" (Solutions).
* **AI Contribution:** **Gemini** wrote the specific copy ("Workforce Automation" -> "New Careers"). **Cursor/Claude** generated the `framer-motion` hook to link glitch intensity to scroll percentage.

### 3. The "Head, Hand, Heart" Orbital System
* **Concept:** Visualizing the campaign's pedagogy as a connected system, not a list.
* **AI Contribution:** **Lovable** generated the responsive logic that switches this from a "3D Orbit" on desktop to a "Stacked Card" layout on mobile.

### 4. The "Resource Matcher" Logic Gate
* **Concept:** An interactive selector for Partners (Expertise/Funding/Space) instead of a static list.
* **AI Contribution:** **Gemini** analyzed the PDF's partnership section and categorized the 5 different ways to partner into 4 simple input choices for better UX.
